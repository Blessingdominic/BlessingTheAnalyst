A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. \n\nUntil now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nMoreno, the director of marketing and manager has set a clear goal: **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. This will be done by analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load packages\n* Start by installing `tidyverse` package:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-22T16:21:44.026510Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-22T16:21:44.028165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-22T16:21:59.925095Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Load packages by using the `library()` function.

Usage Frequency\n- **Annual Members**: Annual members make up approximately 91% of the total rides.\n- **Casual Riders**: Casual riders account for around 9% of the total rides.\n- **Interpretation**: The majority of Cyclistic users are annual members, indicating a preference for membership among frequent riders.\n\n### 2. Ride Duration\n- **Casual Riders**: Casual riders account for approximately 87% of the total ride duration.\n- **Annual Members**: Annual members make up about 13% of the total ride duration.\n- **Interpretation**: Despite being fewer in number, casual riders tend to take longer rides compared to annual members. This could imply that casual riders use Cyclistic bikes for more leisurely or exploratory purposes, while annual members might use them for shorter, possibly more routine commutes.\n\n### 3. Day-Specific Patterns\n- **Highest Number of Rides**: The highest number of rides occurs on **Tuesdays**, with a total of 127,974 rides.\n- **Highest Ride Duration**: The highest ride duration occurs on **Thursdays**, with an average duration of 8,451.67 seconds (approximately 2 hours and 21 minutes).\n- **Interpretation**: \n  - **Tuesdays**: The high number of rides on Tuesdays could suggest that people are more active during the early part of the week, possibly due to work-related commutes or early-week errands.\n  - **Thursdays**: The longer ride durations on Thursdays might indicate that users are taking longer trips as the week progresses, perhaps combining commuting with social activities or leisure before the weekend.\n\n### Summary\n- **Annual Members** dominate in terms of ride frequency, suggesting regular and consistent use, likely for commuting or routine activities.\n- **Casual Riders** take significantly longer rides, indicating their rides are more likely for leisure or exploration.\n- **Tuesdays** and **Thursdays** show distinct patterns in ride numbers and durations, respectively, which could help Cyclistic in planning promotions or maintenance schedules.\n\nThese insights can help Cyclistic tailor its services and marketing strategies to better cater to the needs of both annual members and casual riders, as well as optimize bike availability and maintenance schedules based on day-specific usage patterns.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nBased on the observations, here are three recommendations for Cyclistic:\n\n### 1. **Enhance Membership Benefits and Marketing**\nGiven that annual members constitute 91% of the rides, Cyclistic should focus on:\n- **Loyalty Programs**: Introduce or enhance loyalty programs that reward frequent riders. Benefits could include discounts, exclusive access to new bike models, or priority booking.\n- **Referral Incentives**: Encourage existing members to refer new members by offering incentives such as free ride time or discounts on annual renewals.\n- **Targeted Marketing**: Run marketing campaigns targeting potential annual members, highlighting the cost-effectiveness and convenience of an annual membership for regular commuters.\n\n### 2. **Promote Casual Riding for Leisure and Exploration**\nSince casual riders tend to take longer rides, Cyclistic can:\n- **Leisure Ride Packages**: Offer packages tailored for casual riders, such as day passes or weekend specials, that cater to tourists and occasional users.\n- **Tourism Partnerships**: Collaborate with local tourism boards and attractions to create guided bike tours or special offers that encourage tourists to explore the city using Cyclistic bikes.\n- **Enhance Ride Experience**: Improve bike comfort and introduce features appealing to leisure riders, such as better seats, bike baskets, or GPS-enabled bikes for easier navigation.\n\n### 3. **Optimize Bike Availability and Maintenance Schedules**\nGiven the distinct usage patterns on different days:\n- **Tuesdays**: Increase bike availability and ensure sufficient maintenance staff on Mondays to prepare for the high demand on Tuesdays. This could include redistributing bikes to high-traffic areas.\n- **Thursdays**: Since Thursdays see the longest ride durations, ensure bikes are well-maintained and in top condition mid-week to handle these longer rides. Additionally, consider providing special offers or discounts for long-duration rentals on Thursdays.\n- **Data-Driven Planning**: Continuously analyze ride data to identify other trends and adjust bike distribution and maintenance schedules accordingly. Implement predictive maintenance to reduce downtime and improve the overall user experience.\n\n### Summary\nBy focusing on these strategies, Cyclistic can enhance member satisfaction, attract more casual riders, and ensure optimal bike availability and maintenance, ultimately driving higher usage and better service quality.","metadata":{}}]}
